;; A real soft-currency economy loop layered on the single-player base:
;; defeating an enemy earns currency (defatom); at a spending threshold the
;; player automatically "cashes in" for a temporary weapon-range buff, then
;; the buff decays back down after a fixed window. This is a genuine,
;; common F2P building block (earn -> spend -> temporary power spike), not
;; a claim that free-to-play itself is a distinct core loop.
