# Real compile+execute verification for every games/{genre}/logic.clj.
#
# Two stages, both required -- neither alone is sufficient (iteration-4
# lesson this session, kotoba-lang/kami-engine#95): compiling via the real
# CLJS path (not JVM) catches JS-numeric-semantics bugs JVM tests can't see;
# then actually EXECUTING the emitted bytes via a real WASM host (not just
# `wasm-tools validate`, which only checks structural validity) catches
# anything validate can't -- see PR#95's own history for exactly that gap.
#
# Requires a sibling checkout of kotoba-lang/kami-script-runtime-rs (for the
# `kami-host` binary) -- pass its path as $1, or set KAMI_HOST_REPO.
